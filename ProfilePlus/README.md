Profile+ help you quickly look up colleagues, understand org structure and roles, and learn about open positions. The ability to filter by project and expertise creates new opportunities for like-minded people to find one another and connect. You can update your profile right from within Teams and express your personality by adding a video. Once you find someone you’d like to meet or collaborate with, it’s easy to introduce yourself in chat, give that person a call, or schedule a Teams meeting.
